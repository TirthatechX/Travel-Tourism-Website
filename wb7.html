                Russia’s history dates back to the 9th century, with the formation of the Kievan Rus. It became a powerful state during the reign of Tsars and transformed into the Russian Empire in the 18th century. After the 1917 Revolution, the Russian Empire fell, giving rise to the Soviet Union. In 1991, the USSR dissolved, and modern Russia emerged as a federal republic. Russia has a rich cultural heritage, with contributions to literature, ballet, music, and art. Authors like Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, and composers like Tchaikovsky are world-renowned. The culture reflects a blend of Slavic traditions with European and Asian influences. Orthodox Christianity is the largest religion, but the country is home to multiple ethnic groups and faiths. Russia is a major producer of oil, gas, and minerals, with energy exports forming a significant part of its economy. It also has a growing IT and manufacturing sector.

It comprises 50 states, including the contiguous mainland, the non-contiguous states of Alaska and Hawaii, and several territories like Puerto Rico. European colonization began in the 16th century, with British colonies becoming dominant. The nation declared independence from Britain in 1776, and after the Revolutionary War, it evolved into a democratic republic. The Civil War (1861–1865) addressed the issue of slavery, and the 20th century saw the USA emerge as a global superpower following World War I and World War II​. The USA plays a leading role in global politics, economics, technology, and culture. It houses some of the world's largest companies, like Apple, Microsoft, and Google, and is also home to major institutions like NASA. Its cultural exports, including movies, music, and fashion, have a far-reaching impact globally.
